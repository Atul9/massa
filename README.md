  gem 'massa'
end
```

## About the gem name

"Massa" is a Portuguese slang which means "awesome",
so once you add it to your project, it becomes "massa"!

    $ ... # TODO

Then, run:

    $ massa

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
